Question 1:
Program 2 had overall the best performance, being around 30% percent faster, increasing as the thread count on the computer increases.

Question 2:
Program1 perform its task in a structured manner, where a burst of download, analysis and then categorisation
is performed as the ThreadPool cycles in and out the tasks, which follows the pattern of Program2, save for the fact that lower indexed webpages tend to be
worked on first in the case of Program 1.

Question 3:
Program 1 was overall more performant as Program 3, being about 10% slower.
